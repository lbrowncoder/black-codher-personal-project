        <h1>Guide to choosing the right nursery</h1>
        <p>Finding good quality childcare can be a difficult task for parents. There are lots of things to look out for and to remember to ask when you visit a childcare setting. How do you know if your child will be happy? Will they cater for your child's needs? Do they provide feedback about how your child is doing? What if my child doesn't like it?</p>
        <p>There are many other factors to also consider such as location, type of care, ethos, activities and nutrition. Try and visit a number of nurseries to give yourself an idea of different kinds of nurseries and take your child along so you can see what they think and how the staff interact with your child.</p>            
        <p>Don’t leave it till the last minute to find childcare before you go back to work as some nurseries have waiting lists.</p>
      <p>Draw up a shortlist of childcare providers. Things to consider first:
          <ul>
                <li>Decide which nursery setting will work best for you.</li>
                <li> Do you want a nursery close to home or close to your place of work? </li>
                <li>Do you want a large or a small nursery for your child?</li>
                <li>Is the nursery open just in term-time or does it offer all year round provision?</li>
                <li>What does the OFSTED report say? Does the nursery meet your own standards as a provider?</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Once you have considered the points above, have a look at the point below: 
            <li>The hourly, daily, and/or weekly cost? </li>
            <li> Does the nursery have space available for your child at the time you are looking for? </li>
            <li>The hours that childcare providers can provide childcare?</li>
            <li>Are the parking arrangements convenient?</li>
      </p>
      <h2>Read Reviews</h2>
      <p>The best way to find out what a nursery is really like is to ask the parents of children at the nursery. The easiest way to do this is to read reviews of the nurseries at mywebsite.co.uk. Look on social media sites and online forums to see what people are saying about it.</p>
      <h2>Ofstead</h2>
      <p>Every nursery is inspected by an education watchdog and there will be reports of these inspections online. In England, you can check the Ofsted website, Ofsted visits all registered childcare services and makes sure that standards are being met and that children are safe. You can check Ofsted's grade and report for the childcare providers you are considering at www.ofsted.gov.uk. </p>
      
      <h2>Visit your shortlist</h2>
      <p>It's a good idea to visit several settings and ask questions in person about the childcare provided. It might help to take a friend and/or your child on the visits to help you decide.</p>
