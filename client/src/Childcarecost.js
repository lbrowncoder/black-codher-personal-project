            <h2>Early Years Free Entitlement for All 3- and 4-Year Olds</h2>
                <p>All 3 and 4-year-old children (and many 2-year olds) are entitled to free 
                    childcare here at our nursery, up to a maximum of 30 hours per week (term time only).</p>
            <h2>15 Universal Hours</h2>
                <p>This free entitlement for eligible 2-year olds and all 3- and 4-year olds is at the heart 
                    of the Government’s vision for all children to have access to high quality early years
                     provision in order to help them reach their full potential. 
                     It offers free provision universally, from the term following a child’s third birthday up 
                     until they reach compulsory school age. This free entitlement equates to 15 hours per week
                      (570 hours a year) over a minimum 38 weeks of the year.</p>
                <p>Some two-year-olds in England are entitled to 15 hours free childcare a week in term time with 
                    an approved provider. This entitlement is for the most disadvantaged two-year-olds with 
                    families in England receiving some forms of support.The 15 hours funded childcare equates 
                    to 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year. Some providers will allow parents to stretch these 
                    urs over 52 weeks, using fewer hours per week, subject to a maximum of 570 hours a year.</p>
            <h2>15 Extended Hours (total 30 hours of funding)</h2>
                <p>A further 15 hours is offered to working families for 3- and 4-year olds. You will need to check if
                     you are eligible, but parents can usually get 30 hours childcare if you (and your partner, if you
                      have one) are in work and each are earning at least the National Minimum Wage or Living Wage for 
                      16 hours a week and earn less than £100,000 per annum.
                       Eligibility can be checked at <NavLink to='https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk'>Here</NavLink>You can apply online from gov.uk website for the extra 15 hours (known as 30 hours childcare). If approved, you'll get a childcare account and an eligibility code for 30 hours funded childcare. Give the code in your childcare account to your childcare provider along with your National Insurance number and your child's date of birth. You'll get the extra hours once the next term starts.You must confirm your details are up to date every three months or your code will expire. The government has stated 30 hours funded childcare is not intended to cover the costs of meals, other consumables, additional hours or additional services. You can get 30 hours funded childcare at the same time as claiming Universal Credit, child tax credits, childcare vouchers or Tax-Free Childcare. There's one application for 30 hours funded childcare and Tax-Free Childcare. As part of their application, parents will find out if they can get both.</p>
            <h2>Childcare Vouchers</h2>
                 <p>Working parents can give some of their salary in exchange for childcare vouchers received from their employer to pay towards childcare costs.The voucher scheme across the UK was closed for new joiners from October 4, 2018. However, if employees are currently receiving childcare vouchers they can continue in the scheme for as long as they remain eligible.Money is diverted from a working parents’ salary before it is taxed and put into an account that they can use to pay for a child’s nursery.The vouchers apply for children aged 15 or under (aged 16 if disabled).As long as their employer still offers childcare vouchers and a parent doesn’t leave their company or take an unpaid career break of longer than a year, parents can continue using the scheme. They can do this by renewing their vouchers once a year. In 2019, parents had to renew before the October 4, 2019 deadline.Childcare vouchers are only available if your employer offers them. Only one parent needs to work to be eligible. There is no limit to the income a parent can earn to be eligible. The maximum benefit is £933 a year per parent - so you can get £1,866 if you're part of a couple and both parents apply.</p>
             <h2>Tax-Free childcare</h2>  
                 <p>Parents can pay fees through a Tax Free Childcare account if they are eligible. For every £8 you pay in, the government will add an extra £2, up to £2,000 per child per year, which is up to £500 every three months. To be eligible for the scheme, you must be working (including self-employed) of a child under 12 (or under 17 if disabled). The scheme requires both parents (or single parent) to be working and earning at least £140 a week. Working parents must together earn between £6,830.72 and £100,000 a year. They must earn less than £100,000 per parent. The scheme requires parents (or single parent) to set up special government online accounts, make regular payments and confirm eligibility every 90 days. </p>
            <h2>Universal Credit</h2>
                <p>Universal credit replaces working tax credit and child tax credit. If you receive either of these two benefits, you cannot claim for Universal credit at the same time. For the 2020/21 tax year, families can claim back up to 85 per cent of their eligible childcare costs up to a cap under Universal Credit but they have to cover the upfront costs first and then apply for a reimbursement. Parents in work on Universal Credit with one child can claim up to £646.35 per month for childcare costs and up to £1,108.40 if they have two or more children. You need to apply for Universal Credit online. You must include details of how much you pay for childcare.</p>
            <h2>Working Tax Credit</h2>
                <p>Working Tax Credit is offered in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and is designed to top up your earnings if you work and are on a low income. However, it is being replaced by Universal Credit and most people now have to claim Universal Credit instead.You might be able to claim the ‘childcare element’ of Working Tax Credit to help with up to 70 per cent of your childcare costs. The maximum eligible cost for one child is £175, and £300 for two or more children. If you’re a couple applying together, you can claim up to £2,045 a year and if you’re a single parent, you can also receive up to £2,045 a year. To be eligible for working tax credit, you must either be:
                <li>
                A couple with a child and work at least 24 hours a week between you (with one of you earning at least 16 hours a week.)
                A single parent with a child and work at least 16 hours a week.
                </li>
                </p>
                <p> If parents work less than 24 hours a week between them, they can still claim if they are disabled or aged 60 or above and work at least 16 hours a week. If parents work less than 24 hours a week between you, they can also claim if one partner is in hospital or prison, getting benefits because of disability or ill health or is entitled to Carer’s Allowance. But you must work at least 16 hours a week.</p>
            <h2>Child Tax Credit</h2>
                <p>Child Tax Credit is a benefit in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that helps with the costs of raising a child if you are on a low income. However, it is being replaced by Universal Credit and most people who need help with these costs now have to make a claim for Universal Credit instead.If you’re already claiming Child Tax Credit, you will have to move to Universal Credit at some point before March 2023.The basic ‘family element’ allows people to claim for up to £545. For each child (‘child element’) parents can claim up to £2,830. For each disabled child, parents can claim up to £3,415 (on top of the ‘child element’) and for each severely disabled child, parents can pay up to £1,385 (on top of ‘child element’ and ‘disabled element’.</p>
